## E-CommerceApp

The application lists the data I got from the fakestoreapi using the UrlSession in the CollectionView. I used Firebase Authentication so that the user can register, login and logout to the application. The user can click on any product to see detailed information about the product and add the product to the cart. The user can see the total price of the products on the cart page and can remove the products from the cart. The user can see the e-mail address entered on the profile page and can log out of the application.


### Technologies I used

- VIPER Pattern

- UrlSession
